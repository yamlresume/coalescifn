/**
 * Create a runner that coalesces calls while the wrapped function is running.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - If called while `fn` is running, schedule exactly one follow-up run.
 * - After the current run completes (sync or async), if a follow-up was
 *   scheduled, run once more.
 * - Additional calls during the run are coalesced.
 *
 * Works for both synchronous and Promise-returning functions.
 *
 * @param fn - The function to wrap.
 * @returns A function that coalesces calls if the wrapped function is running.
